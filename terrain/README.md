The data used in the 2003 report "ISPRS Comparison of Filters" is presented
here to aid in the development and testing of PCL-based filters. For more on
the data and the study itself, please see
http://www.itc.nl/isprswgIII-3/filtertest/ and the results of the test as
published in

Sithole, G. and Vosselman, G. (2004) Experimental comparison of filter
algorithms for bare - earth extraction from airborne laser scanning point
clouds. ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing 59 (1-2), 85-101.

The data in this directory has been altered from its original form.

Specifically, the test data for each of the eight sites has been projected into
UTM zone 32U and converted first from ASCII to LAS, and then to PCD. The PCD
version makes no distinction between first and last returns.

For the reference datasets, the data has once again been projected into UTM
zone 32U and converted from ASCII to LAS to PCD. For each sample, we provide
two versions: one cloud with all points, and one with only ground returns.
